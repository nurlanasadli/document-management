# 📁 Document Management System - Frontend (Angular)

This is the **Angular frontend** of the Document Management System. The application offers functionalities like 📄 document management, 🗂️ category organization, and 👥 user & permission control.

This repository is primarily created to **demonstrate the frontend code** I developed using Angular. Since the backend is currently unavailable, the frontend has been slightly modified to run independently.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> This configuration is only for **demo purposes**.  
> - 🔧 API requests have been mocked  
> - 🔓 Authentication has been bypassed  
> Please do not use this setup in a production environment.

> 🏗️ **Note on Folder Structure:**  
> The `frontend` folder is located **inside the `backend` folder** due to a **monorepo-based project structure**.  
> In the original setup, both backend (e.g., Django, Laravel, etc.) and frontend were kept in a single repository to simplify project management and deployment.
